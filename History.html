        <h1> 2008–2011: early years </h1>
        <p> In 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University, where they were both students. 
        Reynolds and Tolman recruited Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, 
        and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano, respectively, for their band. Their name is an anagram for a phrase only 
        known to members of the group, which Reynolds 
        stated each member approved of. The five-piece recorded demos that they uploaded to MySpace that year, but Beck and Florence 
        left the band later that year. In 2009, 
        Tolman recruited long-time high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music, to play guitar. 
        Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, 
        to sing back-up and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. Lemke left the band shortly thereafter, leading 
        Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, 
        Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the line-up. The band garnered a large following in their hometown of 
        Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, 
        the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.
        The band released a self-titled EP Imagine Dragons on September 1, 2009, and Hell and Silence on March 10, 2010, both recorded at 
        Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas. Six months after 
        releasing their third EP, It's Time, on March 12, 2011, they signed a record deal with Interscope Records on November 18, 2011.
        They got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine 
        Dragons was called to fill in and performed to a 
        crowd of more than 26,000 people. Local accolades including "Best CD of 2011" (Vegas SEVEN), "Best Local Indie Band 2010" (Las Vegas 
        Weekly), "Las Vegas' Newest Must See 
        Live Act" (Las Vegas CityLife), Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory. In November 2011, 
        they signed with Interscope Records and 
        began working with English Grammy Award-winning producer Alex da Kid. Eventually, the Tolmans left the group. Drummer Daniel Platzman 
        and keyboardist Theresa Flaminio were recruited 
        by McKee in August 2011, prior to the band's label deal in November 2011. Flaminio departed from the group around the time of the 
        band's deal with Interscope, leaving the band a four-piece.</p>

        <h1> 2012–2014: Night Visions </h1>
        <p> The band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major-label release at Westlake Recording 
        Studios in West Hollywood, California.
        An EP entitled Continued Silence was released on February 14, 2012 digitally and peaked at number 40 on the Billboard 200. 
        The band also released an EP titled Hear Me in 2012.
        Shortly after, "It's Time" was released as a single and peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video debuted on 
        April 17, 2012, on all MTV affiliates and was 
        subsequently nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the "Best Rock Video" category. "It's Time" was certified a 7× platinum 
        single by the RIAA.
        The band finished recording their debut album Night Visions in the summer of 2012 at Studio X inside Palms Casino Resort and 
        released the album in the United States on September 4, 
        2012. It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a 
        debut rock album since 2006. 
        The album also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative and Rock Album charts as well as the top ten on the Australian, 
        Austrian, Canadian, Dutch, German, Irish, Norwegian, 
        Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish, and United Kingdom Albums charts. It won a Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album and was 
        nominated for the Juno Award for International Album 
        of the Year. Night Visions is certified platinum in the US by the RIAA as well as in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, 
        New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, 
        and the UK. The album produced three tracks that reached the Billboard Top 40, four tracks in the ARIA Top 40, and five tracks 
        charting in the UK Top 40.
        The album's second single "Radioactive" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs, Billboard Rock Songs, and Swedish 
        singles chart and has sold more than 14 million singles 
        in the United States, entering the top 3 of the most selling songs digitally ever. It also smashed the record of the longest 
        running song on the Billboard Hot 100 by spending 
        87 weeks before being broken by The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights" in 2021. "Radioactive" stayed at No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs 
        chart for a record-breaking 23 weeks and ultimately 
        became the genre's biggest hit of 2013. It peaked at No. 3, becoming their first top ten single in the United States and broke 
        the record for the longest run into the top five. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>It is the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital history. By the end 
        of 2013, "Radioactive" had already sold over three 
        million copies. Rolling Stone called it "the biggest rock hit of the year". It was also the most streamed song of 2013 on Spotify 
        in the United States. It was nominated for the 
        Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the 
        latter of the two. The band performed a medley of 
        "Radioactive" and "M.A.A.D City" alongside rapper Kendrick Lamar at the ceremony. A remixed version of "Radioactive", featuring a 
        newly added verse from Lamar, was released the next day 
        and performed on the February 1, 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live.
        Third single "Demons" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Songs, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 61 weeks on 
        it. In 2021, RIAA declared that the song has become 
        the band's third diamond selling song in the US. Fourth single "On Top Of The World" reached a peak of No. 79 on the Billboard 
        Hot 100 and also spent 20 weeks on the chart. 
        In the US, the non-singles off the album, "Bleeding Out" and "Amsterdam" were certified platinum while "Hear Me" and "Tiptoe" 
        were certified gold. Billboard listed them as one of 
        "2012's Brightest New Stars" and later "The Breakout Band of 2013". Imagine Dragons won the 2014 Billboard Music Awards for Top 
        Duo/Group, Top Hot 100 Artist, and Top Rock Artist. 
        Amazon.com called the band their "Favorite Rock Artist of 2012".
        In 2013, Imagine Dragons returned to Europe and North America with the Night Visions Tour. The band announced 13 additional US 
        summer tour dates which also sold out. 
        The band then announced a North America Amphitheatre tour. Pollstar listed the band in their Top 20 Concert Tours list by average 
        box office gross despite their average 
        ticket price being the third lowest on the list. The band released a live album, Live at Independent Records, in April 2013.</p>

        <p> The idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their "New Year's resolution", was to create music and finish it when 
            the band feels that their work is done. Since the 
        beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the 
        start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, 
        before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work 
        from.
        Prior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film 
        Transformers: Age of Extinction, called "Battle Cry" 
        (June 2014) and song "Warriors" for the 2014 League of Legends World Championship (September 2014).
        On October 24, they revealed the lead single to the upcoming album, "I Bet My Life" via several visual snippets on Facebook and 
        Instagram. It was released on October 27. 
        It was sent to US Alternative radio for ads on November 3. On December 16, the band announced their second album Smoke + Mirrors, 
        along with the release of its second single "Gold". 
        "Shots" was released as the album's third single on January 26, 2015.
        Imagine Dragons played at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles on February 5, 2015. The half-hour set included the live debut of 
        unreleased songs "Summer" and "I'm So Sorry". On February 8, 
        the band partnered with Target for a performance of "Shots" as part of a live commercial aired during the Grammy Awards. 
        Smoke + Mirrors was released on February 17. The album debuted 
        atop the Billboard 200, making it the band's first number one album. The band began a world tour in support of the album on 
        June 3 in Portland, Oregon.
        During the band's tour, Imagine Dragons released two non-album singles. "Roots" was released on August 26, 2015, and "I Was Me" 
        on October 12, 2015, via iTunes. The band also released 
        a cover of "I Love You All the Time" by Eagles of Death Metal on December 18, 2015, in support of the victims of the November 
        2015 Paris attacks. The Smoke + Mirrors Tour ended on February 5, 
        2016, in Amsterdam. The band released a one night only concert film, Imagine Dragons In Concert: Smoke + Mirrors, in select 
        theaters on March 2, 2016, which was later released on DVD and Blu-Ray.
        Following the tour, the band planned to take a hiatus. They released the soundtracks songs "Not Today" from Me Before You and 
        "Sucker for Pain" from Suicide Squad with Lil Wayne, 
        Wiz Khalifa, Logic, Ty Dolla Sign, and X Ambassadors in April and June, respectively.</p>
